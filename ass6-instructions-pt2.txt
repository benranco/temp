Hello, Ben:

Your running outcome looks great, they are what we want. Next step, please consider move onto whitebark pine, starting from Trinity first, then transdecode, and megan6. Thanks.

Steps:
- raw data is in four subfolders of /public/genomics/Data-Dec2020/WBP-NGS-rawData
- trimmomatic for quality control on each raw data file
- combine the files into a master R1 and R2 file for Trinity?
- will I need 1 TB or 2 TB memory for Trinity? Hopefully can use 2 TB. Will I need to split it into two subsets and run on Trinity separately?
- Trinity
- Transdecode
- BLASTp (using a different strategy?)
- MEGAN6
