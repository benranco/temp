Hello, Ben:
We have a small set of seqs that needed to be trimmed. Based on sequence positions listed in column ‘alignment start’ and ‘alignment end’ in the Sheet ‘NB742-735’, we need to trim seqs by removal amino acids before ‘alignment start’ and after ‘alignment end’.

For example: ...

We need to keep sequence from position 224 to 451 for WWP18_DN10008_c2_g1_i2.p1.
A few seqs need to be trimmed more than once. For these cases, you just add –a, -b, or –c to the original seq IDs.
Let us have a discussion if you have any questions.

Hello, Ben:
In total, we have four sets of seqs needed to be trimmed as enclosed. Thanks.

Hello, Ben:
Probably you have not touched sequence trim yet. I have a update on the input data as enclosed. Please process this updated set if you have not tried on the previous set.
Just let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks.

Hi Jun-Jun,

I've completed the sequence trim on the most recent updated data you sent me. Attached are the results. For sequence ids that occur more than once, I added "-fn" to the sequence id, where n is a unique number. 

I've also pasted below the output of my sequence trim script, which recorded some off-by-one differences in your expected alignment length and the trimmed alignment length.

Hello, Ben:
Great output!. I’ll look at them, and let you any modification is required.
BTW, I send you the seq data based on filtering from both longest and PYM=I for BLAST through Dropbox. Please let me know if you can access and download them.
Thanks.

Ben:

please see enclosed file to pick up lengest seq for representative of the genes.

An example as  below, seq 1 ~ seq4 belong to the gene 'comp21958_c0'. Please pick up the row  'comp21958_c0_seq3' for this gene and the longest length '313' as the gene length.
Name	Length
comp21958_c0_seq1	272
comp21958_c0_seq2	218
comp21958_c0_seq3	313

Hello, Ben:
Hope all is well and that you got some time off for Christmas/Holiday period.
Enclosed are file for you to trim the sequences, only keeping sequences for each with the same mIDs from positions of ‘Querry start’ to ‘Querry end’ as shown in the tab.
Thanks!

Hi Jun-Jun, thanks, I had a very good and very busy Christmas/New Year with family. I will try to make up some time this week by looking again at the LD paper. 

I've just checked the progress of the BLASTx runs on the WBP47 data, and more than half of them have finished, so I think the remaining half will finish soon. 

I've attached the trimmed version of the Total-205+14nt.fasta file based on your instructions above. My script identified a few warnings, one because the sequence WWP18_DN4669_c0_g1_i1 wasn't found in the fasta file, and the rest because the trimmed sequence length didn't match the Hit length. I've pasted these below.

For the missing sequence, I did find one WWP18_DN4669_c0_g1_i11, but I don't think it was intended because its sequence was shorter than the 'Query end' for WWP18_DN4669_c0_g1_i1.

Ben
